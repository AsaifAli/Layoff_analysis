# Employee stability Analytics: Predicting Modeling for Layoffs
In today's dynamic economic landscape, understanding the factors leading to company layoffs is crucial for both employers and employees. This project aims to predict the reasons for company layoffs using machine learning techniques like sarimax, BI and GRU etc. By leveraging historical data on layoffs, including company attributes, employee demographics, economic conditions, and internal factors, we develop predictive models to classify the primary reasons behind layoffs. Our research aims to clarify the factors that influence decisions regarding downsizing the workforce, with the goal of helping stakeholders take proactive measures to manage employment risks and minimize the negative effects of layoffs on both employees andÂ organizations. The knowledge derived from this project holds significance for companies, policymakers, and individuals seeking employment, offering valuable insights that can inform decision-making processes for all stakeholders involved.
